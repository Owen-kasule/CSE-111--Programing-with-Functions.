Proposal: Calculator for Basic and Advanced Operations
Program Title
Calculator for Basic and Advanced Operations

Program Description
In education, engineering, finance, and everyday life, users often need a reliable and versatile tool to perform quick and accurate calculations. This program is designed to solve this real-world problem by offering an easy-to-use calculator that handles basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced operations (e.g., trigonometric functions, logarithms, and power calculations). Additionally, the calculator includes features like unit conversion (e.g., between metric and imperial systems) and statistical analysis (mean, median, and mode). With an intuitive command-line interface, the program aims to save time and increase productivity for students, professionals, and anyone requiring a computational tool.

Learning Objectives
By developing this program, I aim to:

Learn to handle user input and validate it for correctness.
Improve proficiency with modular programming by dividing tasks into specific functions.
Gain deeper understanding of mathematical libraries in Python, such as math and statistics.
Implement error handling to ensure robust functionality and user-friendly messaging.
Practice writing and executing test cases using pytest to ensure code accuracy and reliability.
Modules Used
The program will use the following modules:

math - For advanced mathematical functions like trigonometric calculations.
statistics - For performing statistical operations such as calculating mean, median, and mode.
pytest - For writing and executing test functions to verify program correctness.
Function Names
The following functions are planned for the program:

add(a, b) - Performs addition of two numbers.
subtract(a, b) - Performs subtraction of two numbers.
multiply(a, b) - Performs multiplication of two numbers.
divide(a, b) - Performs division of two numbers with error handling for division by zero.
calculate_trig(function, value) - Computes trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, and tangent.
logarithm(base, value) - Calculates the logarithm of a number for a given base.
convert_units(value, unit_from, unit_to) - Handles unit conversion between metric and imperial systems.
statistical_analysis(data_list) - Computes mean, median, and mode of a given dataset.
get_user_input() - Retrieves and validates user input.
main() - Orchestrates the programâ€™s workflow.
Test Function Names
The following test functions will be implemented:

test_add() - Verifies the correctness of the addition function.
test_subtract() - Tests the subtraction function.
test_multiply() - Ensures the multiplication function works as expected.
test_divide() - Confirms division, including error handling for division by zero.
test_calculate_trig() - Validates trigonometric calculations.
test_logarithm() - Checks the accuracy of logarithmic calculations.
test_convert_units() - Ensures unit conversion is accurate.
test_statistical_analysis() - Validates statistical functions like mean, median, and mode.

Summary
This program will serve as a comprehensive tool for handling various mathematical and statistical calculations, addressing real-world needs for students and professionals. It is modular, user-friendly, and robust, and will provide valuable learning experience in Python programming, mathematical computations, and software testing.
